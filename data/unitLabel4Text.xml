The Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment, radar astronomy and the Deep Space Network determine distances to the Moon,[78] planets[79] and spacecraft,[80] respectively, by measuring round-trip transit times.There are different ways to determine the value of c. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which can be done in various astronomical and earth-based setups.However, it is also possible to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants 0 and 0 and using their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling c.In 1983 the metre was defined as "the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1299,792,458 of a second",[81] fixing the value of the speed of light at 299792458 m/s by definition, as described below.</ht>

The higher energies of the ultraviolet spectrum from wavelengths about 120 nm to 10 nm ('extreme' ultraviolet) are ionizing, but, due to this effect, these wavelengths are absorbed by nitrogen and even more strongly by dioxygen, and thus have an extremely short path length through air.[1] However, the entire spectrum of ultraviolet radiation has some of the biological features of ionizing radiation: It does far more damage to many molecules in biological systems than is accounted for by simple heating effects (an example is sunburn).

This behavior causes the formally ionizing part of ultraviolet to be completely absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.Extreme UV (EUV) is characterized by a transition in the physics of interaction with matter: Wavelengths longer than about 30 nm interact mainly with the chemical valence electrons of matter, whereas shorter wavelengths interact mainly with inner-shell electrons and nuclei.The long end of the EUV/XUV spectrum is set by a prominent He+ spectral line at 30.4 nm.

An example is "gamma rays" from lightning discharges at 10  to 20 MeV, and known to be produced by the bremsstrahlung mechanism.Another example is gamma-ray bursts, now known to be produced from processes too powerful to involve simple collections of atoms undergoing radioactive decay.This has led to the realization that many gamma rays produced in astronomical processes result not from radioactive decay or particle annihilation, but rather in much the same manner as the production of X-rays.

His result of 186,355 miles per second (299,910 km/s) was accepted as the most accurate measurement of the speed of light for forty years, when Michelson remeasured it.Einstein and special relativity
 In 1905, Albert Einstein wrote his first paper on special relativity.In it, he established that light travels at the same speed no matter how fast the observer moves.</ht>

Somewhere in outer space, billions of light years from Earth, the original light associated with the Big Bang of the universe is blazing new ground as it continues moving outward.In stark contrast, another form of electromagnetic radiation originating on the Earth, radio waves from the inaugural live episode of The Lucy Show are broadcasting a premier somewhere in deep space, although greatly reduced in amplitude.The basic concept behind both events involves the speed of light (and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation), which scientists have thoroughly examined, and is now expressed as a constant value denoted in equations by the symbol c. Not truly a constant, but rather the maximum speed in a vacuum, the speed of light, which is almost 300,000 kilometres per second, can be manipulated by changing media or with quantum interference.Light traveling in a uniform substance, or medium, propagates in a straight line at a relatively constant speed, unless it is refracted, reflected, diffracted, or perturbed in some other manner.</ht>

For example, for visible light the refractive index of glass is typically around 1.5, meaning that light in glass travels at c / 1.5  200000km/s; the refractive index of air for visible light is 1.000293, so the speed of light in air is 299705km/s or about 88km/s slower than c.In most practical cases, light and other electromagnetic waves can be thought of as moving "instantaneously", but for long distances and very sensitive measurements their finite speed has noticeable effects.For example, in videos of an intense lightning storm on the Earth's surface taken from the International Space Station, the expansion of light wavefronts from individual flashes of lightning is clearly visible, and allows estimates of the speed of light to be made from frame-to-frame analysis of the position of the light wavefront.</ht>

The effects of gravitation can only be accurately represented by a tensor field).Contrary to Special Relativity, the measured speed of light in a gravitational field is not a constant, but rather a variable depending upon the reference frame of the observer; what one observer sees as true another observer sees as false.The only observers that can actually agree that the speed of light outside gravitational fields is 299792.458 km/s are those who are themselves outside gravitational fields.</ht>

This is why these kinds of radiation are dangerous to life.Ordinary glass does not let radiation through if its wavelength is less than 200nanometres, so it acts as a shield against the more dangerous range of ultraviolet light, but some special sorts of glass do not shield as well, including many car windows.One use for ultraviolet radiation is tanning.Use of tanning devices can cause skin cancer because ultraviolet goes through the skin and causes destruction to cells, causing sunburn.Because of the destructive power of ultraviolet light, it can be used to kill germs.

Of the ultraviolet radiation that reaches the Earth's surface, up to 95% is UVA (the very longest wavelength),[11] depending on cloud cover and atmospheric conditions.Ordinary glass is partially transparent to UVA but is opaque to shorter wavelengths, whereas silica or quartz glass, depending on quality, can be transparent even to vacuum UV wavelengths.Ordinary window glass passes about 90% of the light above 350nm, but blocks over 90% of the light below 300nm.

The wavelength of violet light is around 400 nanometres (or 4,000 Å).Ultraviolet radiation oscillates at rates between about 800 terahertz (THz or 1012 hertz) and 30,000 THz.The ultraviolet spectrum is sometimes subdivided into the near UV (380 to 200 nanometre wavelengths) and extreme UV (200 to 10 nm wavelengths).

This behavior causes the formally ionizing part of ultraviolet to be completely absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.Extreme UV (EUV) is characterized by a transition in the physics of interaction with matter: Wavelengths longer than about 30nm interact mainly with the chemical valence electrons of matter, whereas shorter wavelengths interact mainly with inner-shell electrons and nuclei.The long end of the EUV/XUV spectrum is set by a prominent He+ spectral line at 30.4nm.

Density is a physical property constant at a given temperature and density can help to identify a substance.Relative density of a substance is the ratio of the substance to the density of water at 4oC, i.e.An unknown liquid substance has a mass of 18.5 g and occupies a volume of 23.4 ml.(millilitre).The density can be calculated as = [(18.5 g) / (1000 g/kg)] / [(23.4 ml) / (1000 ml/l) (1000 l/m3)] = (18.5 10-3 kg) / (23.4 10-6 m3) = 790 (kg/m3)If we look up densities of some common liquids, we can find that ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, has a density of 7789 kg/m3.

<ht>
Only a photon with an energy of exactly 10.2 eV can 
 be absorbed or emitted when the electron jumps between the n = 1 and n = 2 
 energy levels.The energy that a photon carries depends on its wavelength.Since the photons 
 absorbed or emitted by electrons jumping between the n = 1 and n = 2 energy levels must 
 have exactly 10.2 eV of energy, the light absorbed or emitted must have a definite 
 wavelength.

They are an excellent depiction of why the solid state drive is going to revolutionize consumer data storage alot sooner than we think.What are Its Disadvantages?Presently, there are three glaring disadvantages to the SSD, these being price, storage capacity and availability.While we see prices dropping rapidly, one can still expect to pay upwards around $600-700 for the 32Gb Sandisk if its purchased on its own.You will find this easily doubled for the new Samsung 64Gb SSD and prices havent been released for the fastest SSD on the planet as claimed by Mtron, but its present 32Gb SSD (which is still well ahead of the pack) can be had for $1,500US.Size is then another consideration.</ht>

Thus barometric pressure was reported in "inches of mercury".As the world standardized to a metric standard, "inches" became obsolete, and were converted to metric millimetres.People noticed that the height of a column of mercury in the barometre at a pressure of 1 atmosphere was almost exactly 760 mm (760.087 mm).</ht>

The lowest measurable sea-level pressure is found at the centers of tropical cyclones and tornadoes, with a record low of 870 mbar (87 kPa) (see Atmospheric pressure records).Pressure varies smoothly from the Earth's surface to the top of the mesosphere.Although the pressure changes with the weather, NASA has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year-round.</ht>

Even at an altitude of 2000 metres (less than Denver, CO), atmospheric pressure due to altitude would be about 795 millibars, a much greater decrease than the most extreme weather conditions.Even on a smaller scale, local topography can be quite variable even a few miles away.</ht>

So standard pressure at sea level would be 1013.25 millibars.This would be usually measured as 1013 millibars or at most 1013.2 millibars, since that is the usual standard of precision for weather instruments.Variation with altitude was mentioned briefly at the beginning of this document.</ht>

The pressures that are considered high pressure or low pressure do not depend on geographical location.This makes isobars on a weather map meaningful and useful tools.The altimetre setting in aviation, set either QNH or QFE, is another atmospheric pressure reduced to sea level, but the method of making this reduction differs slightly.QFE and QNH are arbitrary Q codes rather than abbreviations, but the mnemonics "Nautical Height" (for QNH) and "Field Elevation" (for QFE) are often used by pilots to distinguish them.Average sea-level pressure is 101.325 kPa (1013.25 mbar, or hPa) or 29.92inches (inHg) or 760 millimetres of mercury (mmHg).</ht>
